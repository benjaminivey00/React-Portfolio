          I donâ€™t have any coding experience before graduating the UofU bootcamp right after getting through highschool. I see this as an advantage, it shows that I am a fast learner and a very hard worker. I know I have great work ethic because I have always had 2 jobs or balanced work and education. I have strong communication and collaboration skills so I work well in a team. 
In pursuit of becoming a Full Stack Web Developer, strong skills include, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, express, Mysql, Node, MongoDB, mongoose, React, Communication, Collaboration and Teamwork
